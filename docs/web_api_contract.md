# Web API contract — Upload & Analyze (v1, `schema_version` "1.0")

`schema_version` stays `"1.0"`: additive request/response settings retain defaults for existing clients. Pixels displayed by the current web UI are anonymized with local YuNet face detection; dense pipeline video includes face boxes for every decoded frame, while image/frame JPEGs contain blurred pixels.

Demo prototype only: no production, no live CCTV.
Example responses: `tests/fixtures/api/*.json` (they conform exactly to this document).

## 0. Conventions

- All bodies are JSON (`application/json; charset=utf-8`). Numbers are JSON numbers; `float` values are rounded to 4 decimals.
- **Coordinates:** `xyxy` = `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, `float`, **pixels in the coordinate system of the original source frame** (`source.width` × `source.height`, origin top-left, x right, y down), `0 <= x1 < x2 <= width`, `0 <= y1 < y2 <= height`. Never letterboxed/model-input coordinates, never normalised.
- **Time:** every `*_s` field is seconds (`float`), measured from the start of the video.
- **Images in responses:** `image_jpeg_b64` = standard base64 (RFC 4648, with `=` padding) of a full-resolution JPEG with detected faces blurred and no detection annotations. **No** `data:image/jpeg;base64,` prefix — the client adds it. Detection boxes are drawn by the browser.
- "Nullable: no" means the key is always present and never `null`. Keys are never omitted.
- Unknown extra request fields are ignored.

### 0.1 Common envelope (analyze responses and health)

| Field | Type | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `is_model_output` | bool | no | `true` on both analyze endpoints. `false` on `/api/health` (it carries no model output). |
| `model` | string | health: yes (`null`); analyze: no | `"yolov8n"` \| `"yolov8s"` (Stage 1), `"x3d_s"` (Stage 2) |
| `schema_version` | string | no | This contract's version: `"1.0"` |
| `disclaimer` | string | no | Fixed text below, identical in every response |

Disclaimer (exact string):

```text
ต้นแบบเพื่อการศึกษา (pilot) ฝึกด้วยชุดข้อมูลสาธารณะเท่านั้น ไม่ใช่ระบบใช้งานจริง และยังไม่ได้ตรวจสอบความถูกต้องกับกล้อง CCTV เป้าหมาย / Educational pilot trained on public datasets only. Not a production system and not validated on the target CCTV cameras.
```

Error responses do **not** use the envelope (see section 4).

### 0.2 Uploads (both analyze endpoints)

- `multipart/form-data`; file field name **`file`** (exactly one file).
- Media type is decided by the **file extension** (case-insensitive); the part's `Content-Type` is not trusted.
  - Image: `.jpg .jpeg .png .bmp .webp` (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/bmp`, `image/webp`)
  - Video: `.mp4 .avi .mov .mkv` (`video/mp4`, `video/x-msvideo`, `video/quicktime`, `video/x-matroska`)
  - Any other extension → `415 unsupported_media_type`.
- Size limit **100 MB** (104 857 600 bytes) per file → above it `413 file_too_large`.
- Decoded size limits: images ≤ 40,000,000 pixels and video frames ≤ 16,777,216 pixels (4K supported); exceeding a limit returns `413 media_dimensions_too_large`.
- At most one analysis request runs per server process; another concurrent analysis returns `429 analysis_busy`. Multipart data may already be spooled by the server before this inference gate runs.
- A file with an allowed extension that OpenCV/Pillow cannot decode (or a video with 0 decodable frames or fps <= 0) → `422 decode_failed`. Codec support depends on the local OpenCV build; mp4/avi/mov are expected to work.
- Optional privacy fields: `face_confidence` (0.20..0.90, default 0.35), `face_padding` (0..0.50, default 0.25), and `face_blur_strength` (0.40..1.50, default 0.80). Lower confidence accepts weaker face detections; greater padding/strength obscures more area. The detector still processes every frame and cannot be disabled from this endpoint.
- Optional `analysis_settings`: JSON string with YOLO thresholds/inference controls, X3D fight probability cutoff, and experimental tracking/trigger parameters. Omitted values use the defaults below; invalid values return `400 invalid_parameter`. Per-class YOLO confidence defaults to `configs/thresholds.yaml`; inference defaults are IoU `0.7`, image size `640`, max detections `300`. X3D fight cutoff defaults to `0.5`. Tracking defaults are proximity `0.16` frame diagonals, motion `0.25` diagonals/s, track gap `0.75` s. Bounds are checked server-side. These controls affect inference/decision rules, not trained model weights; changing them does not retrain or calibrate a model.

Example `analysis_settings` value:

```json
{"yolo":{"thresholds":{"person":0.25,"helmet":0.2,"vest":0.2,"fall":0.2,"fire":0.2,"smoke":0.2},"iou":0.7,"imgsz":640,"max_det":300},"x3d":{"fight_threshold":0.5},"tracking":{"proximity_diagonals":0.16,"motion_diagonals_per_s":0.25,"max_track_gap_s":0.75}}
```

### 0.3 `source` object (Stage 1 and Stage 2)

| Field | Type | Units | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `width` | int | px | no | Original frame width |
| `height` | int | px | no | Original frame height |
| `fps` | float | frames/s | image: `null` | Video frame rate reported by the decoder |
| `frame_count` | int | frames | image: `null` | Total frames in the video |
| `duration_s` | float | s | image: `null` | `frame_count / fps` |

## 1. `GET /api/health`

Never loads models; only reports state. Always `200` while the server is up.

| Field | Type | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| envelope | — | — | `is_model_output: false`, `model: null` |
| `status` | string | no | Always `"ok"` |
| `device` | string | no | e.g. `"cuda:0"` or `"cpu"` |
| `models` | object | no | Keys exactly `yolov8n`, `yolov8s`, `x3d_s`; each value `"loaded"` (in memory) \| `"available"` (weights file present, not loaded yet) \| `"missing"` (weights file absent) |

Fixture: `health.json`.

## 2. `POST /api/stage1/analyze` — YOLOv8 detector (image or video)

Form fields:

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | file | yes | — | Image or video (0.2) |
| `model` | string | yes | — | `yolov8n` \| `yolov8s`; else `400 invalid_parameter` |
| `max_frames` | int | no | `16` | `1..60` inclusive; else `400 invalid_parameter`. Validated in `frames` mode, including images, though images do not use it. Ignored (not validated) in `dense` mode |
| `mode` | string | no | `"frames"` | `"frames"` (sampled frames with JPEGs, the v1 behaviour) \| `"dense"` (video only, boxes only, for playback overlay); anything else → `400 invalid_parameter` |
| `sample_fps` | float | no | `10` | Dense mode only: finite number in `1..30` inclusive (e.g. `"10"`, `"12.5"`); else `400 invalid_parameter`. Ignored (not validated) in `frames` mode |
| `analysis_settings` | JSON string | no | see 0.2 | Per-request settings for all model and trigger controls |

Empty-string form values count as "not sent" and get the default. The `mode` value has surrounding whitespace trimmed before it is checked.

Response `200`:

| Field | Type | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| envelope | — | — | `is_model_output: true`, `model` = requested model |
| `detector_schema_version` | int | no | `2` (`cctv_safety/schema.py` `DETECTOR_SCHEMA_VERSION`) |
| `class_names` | string[] | no | `["person","helmet","vest","fall","fire","smoke"]`; `class_id` is the index in this list |
| `media_type` | string | no | `"image"` \| `"video"` |
| `source` | object | no | Section 0.3 |
| `thresholds` | object | no | Per-class min confidence used (from `configs/thresholds.yaml`); keys exactly `class_names` |
| `ppe_min_confidence` | float | no | `min(thresholds.person, thresholds.helmet, thresholds.vest)`; passed to `assess_ppe` (same as `scripts/infer.py`) |
| `mode` | string | no | `"frames"` \| `"dense"` (the mode actually used; images are always `"frames"`) |
| `sample_fps` | float | `frames` mode: `null` | Dense mode: the `sample_fps` used (rounded to 4 decimals) |
| `frames` | Frame[] | no | Ordered by `index` ascending; never empty |

Frame selection, `mode = "frames"` (default; unchanged from v1):
- **Image:** exactly one frame: `index: 0`, `time_s: null`.
- **Video:** `n = min(max_frames, frame_count)`; indices = unique values of `round(linspace(0, frame_count-1, n))` (so the first and last frames are always included); `time_s = index / fps`.

Frame selection, `mode = "dense"` (video only):
- An image upload → `422 video_required`. A video that Stage 2 would split into more than 30 windows (section 3, roughly `D >= 61 s`) → `422 video_too_long`.
- Sample times `t_k = k / sample_fps` for `k = 0, 1, …` while `t_k < duration_s` (`duration_s = frame_count / fps`).
- Frame index per sample, exactly (Python, round-half-to-even): `min(int(round(k / sample_fps * fps)), frame_count - 1)`; duplicates are removed (first occurrence kept). So `sample_fps >= fps` yields every frame.
- `time_s = index / fps` (as in frames mode); `image_jpeg_b64` is `null` for every frame (the browser plays the original file and draws boxes over it).
- Example: 8.0 s at 30 fps with `sample_fps = 10` → 80 frames, indices `0, 3, 6, …, 237`, `time_s` `0.0, 0.1, …, 7.9`.

Frame:

| Field | Type | Units | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `index` | int | frame number | no | 0-based frame number in the source video (`0` for images) |
| `time_s` | float | s | image: `null`; video: no | |
| `image_jpeg_b64` | string | — | `frames` mode: no; `dense` mode: always `null` | Raw frame JPEG, base64, no `data:` prefix (section 0) |
| `detections` | Detection[] | — | no | Only boxes with `confidence >= thresholds[class_name]`; sorted by `confidence` descending; may be `[]` |
| `ppe` | PpeRow[] | — | no | Output of `cctv_safety.ppe.assess_ppe(detections, ppe_min_confidence)` unchanged; may be `[]` |

After confidence filtering, the pilot detector suppresses a `person` box only when
it spans at least 90% of frame height, at least 45% of frame width, touches both
top and bottom edges within 3%, and overlaps a `fall` box at IoU 0.20 or above.
This narrow geometry guard targets the oversized full-frame false positives seen
in the standing-to-fall clip; it is a heuristic and may suppress a real unusually
close person during a detected fall. Ordinary person boxes and all `fall` boxes
are preserved. It does not make the detector generally validated.

Detection:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `class_id` | int | `0..5`, `CLASS_TO_ID[class_name]` |
| `class_name` | string | One of `class_names` |
| `confidence` | float | `0..1` |
| `xyxy` | float[4] | Source-frame pixels (section 0) |

PpeRow (exactly the keys produced by `assess_ppe`; these are **derived** events, not model classes):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `person_index` | int | 0-based index among the frame's `person` detections with `confidence >= ppe_min_confidence`, in `detections` order (i.e. the n-th person in the list) |
| `person_confidence` | float | That person's confidence |
| `has_helmet` | bool | A helmet centre lies in the top 0–35 % of the person box |
| `has_vest` | bool | A vest centre lies in the 20–75 % band of the person box |
| `alerts` | string[] | Subset of `["no_helmet","no_vest"]` in that order; `[]` if compliant |
| `method` | string | `"ppe-centre-in-person-region"` |

Fixtures: `stage1_image.json`, `stage1_video.json` (requested with `max_frames=3`), `stage1_video_dense.json` (`mode=dense`, `sample_fps=10`, 1.0 s clip at 10 fps → 10 frames).

## 3. `POST /api/stage2/analyze` — X3D-S fight classifier (video only)

Form fields: `file` only (video). An image extension → `422 video_required`.

Windowing (`D = duration_s`, `W = 2.0`):
- Non-overlapping windows `[k·W, min((k+1)·W, D)]`, `k = 0, 1, …`.
- The final partial window is included only if its length is **>= 1.0 s**; otherwise those trailing frames are dropped.
- If `D < 2.0`, exactly one window `[0, D]` covering the whole clip (any length).
- More than **30** windows → `422 video_too_long` (i.e. roughly `D >= 61 s`).
- Per window: frames `round(start_s·fps) .. min(round(end_s·fps), frame_count) - 1`, of which 13 are taken with `round(linspace(first, last, 13))` (repeats allowed), then the plan's X3D-S preprocessing (letterbox 224, normalise).

Response `200`:

| Field | Type | Units | Nullable | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| envelope | — | — | — | `is_model_output: true`, `model: "x3d_s"` |
| `source` | object | — | no | Section 0.3 (video, so no nulls) |
| `class_names` | string[] | — | no | `["non_fight","fight"]` (logit index 0/1) |
| `frames_per_window` | int | frames | no | `13` |
| `window_s` | float | s | no | `2.0` (nominal window length) |
| `windows` | Window[] | — | no | Ordered by `start_s`; 1..30 entries |
| `summary` | object | — | no | See below |

Window:

| Field | Type | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index` | int | — | 0-based window number |
| `start_s` | float | s | `index · 2.0` |
| `end_s` | float | s | `min(start_s + 2.0, duration_s)` |
| `probs` | object | — | `{non_fight: float, fight: float}` = `softmax(logits)`, each `0..1`, sum 1 (± rounding) |
| `label` | string | — | `class_names[argmax(logits)]`; tie → `"non_fight"` |

Summary:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `max_fight_prob` | float | `max(windows[*].probs.fight)` |
| `fight_windows` | int | Count of windows with `label == "fight"` |
| `total_windows` | int | `len(windows)` |

Fixture: `stage2_video.json` (5.4 s clip → windows 0–2, 2–4, 4–5.4).

## 3.1 `POST /api/pipeline/analyze` — combined shadow-mode video evaluation

Form fields: `file` (video), `model` (`yolov8n` or `yolov8s`), and optional
`sample_fps` (1..30; default 10). The endpoint runs dense Stage 1 detections,
greedily associates person boxes across sampled frames using IoU and centre
distance, then calculates per-window proximity and centre-motion signals. A
candidate triggers when at least two detected people are within 0.16 frame
diagonals, or at least two people are present and one moves at 0.25 frame
diagonals/s or faster. Track association expires after 0.75 s. These are
exploratory defaults, not calibrated Fight thresholds.
The tracking implementation associates raw person detection boxes; it does not
confirm unique identities. Duplicate detections can create duplicate tracks and
can therefore influence the experimental trigger. `tracked_people` and
`max_concurrent_tracks` are track counts, not verified head counts.

This endpoint is intentionally **shadow mode**: it runs X3D on every window,
including windows without a candidate trigger. That keeps missed-trigger cases
visible while the trigger is evaluated. Its output must not be interpreted as
an optimized or production event pipeline.

All frame selection, windowing, thresholds, and common error behavior match
sections 0–4. Person detections in `stage1.frames` also carry `track_id` and
`motion_diagonals_per_s`. There is no added temporal confidence threshold.
In the combined pipeline, an X3D `fight` label overlapping any sampled YOLO
`fall` detection is preserved as the raw model output but its pipeline decision
is `review_fall_fight_conflict`; the UI labels it ambiguous for human review.
Fight predictions without that conflict are `fight_candidate` (pilot output),
not a confirmed incident. `fight_windows` continues to count raw X3D predictions.

### Privacy display behavior

- YOLO/X3D use original decoded frames in local process memory. Stage 1 image/frame JPEGs are encoded only after YuNet face detection and blurring on a copy; model input arrays are not modified.
- `/api/pipeline/analyze` scans every decoded source frame and returns padded face boxes per frame and a blurred preview JPEG. The browser draws the hidden original video only into an opaque canvas and blurs each displayed frame. If metadata is incomplete or canvas drawing fails, the canvas is blacked out.
- YuNet reuses the configured input size while frame dimensions remain unchanged; it still runs face detection on every frame. This avoids repeatedly resetting an identical detector input shape without lowering scan frequency or changing the model input pixels.
- `timings_ms` separately records decoder reads (plus metadata/Stage 2 sampled decode), YuNet detector calls, total scan wall time, YOLO, X3D, first preview encoding, response assembly and total request time. It is diagnostic timing, not a latency guarantee; total can differ slightly from the sum because stages overlap or include orchestration.
- A missing/unloadable local YuNet model returns 503 `privacy_model_unavailable`. Processing errors do not trigger a raw-media display fallback. Uploaded temporary files are removed in the endpoint's `finally` block.
- YuNet may miss small, blurred, profile or occluded faces. This is a pilot privacy aid, not a guarantee of anonymization or PDPA compliance. Review representative footage manually before use.

Place `face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx` in the ignored `weights/` folder. It comes from [OpenCV Zoo face_detection_yunet](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/tree/main/models/face_detection_yunet), under MIT terms; see the upstream README for model-specific attribution. For a fresh checkout, download it from the upstream model asset:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force weights | Out-Null
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/opencv/opencv_zoo/main/models/face_detection_yunet/face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx `
  -OutFile weights/face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx
```

`settings` echoes the applied privacy values. `detection_ms` sums YuNet call time across frames; `scan_wall_ms` measures the full decode/anonymization scan excluding interleaved YOLO batch calls. Both are separate from Stage 1/2 inference.

## 4. Errors

Every non-2xx response has exactly this body (no envelope):

```json
{"error": {"code": "<code>", "message": "<human-readable English text>"}}
```

`code` is from the fixed list below; clients branch on `code`, never on `message`. FastAPI's default validation errors are remapped to this format.

| HTTP | `code` | When |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `missing_file` | No `file` part, or the file is empty (0 bytes) |
| 400 | `invalid_parameter` | `model` missing/not `yolov8n`/`yolov8s`; `max_frames` not an int in 1..60 (frames mode); `mode` not `frames`/`dense`; `sample_fps` not a number in 1..30 (dense mode) |
| 413 | `file_too_large` | Upload > 100 MB |
| 413 | `media_dimensions_too_large` | Decoded image/video frame exceeds the pixel limit in section 0.2 |
| 429 | `analysis_busy` | Another analysis is already running in this server process |
| 415 | `unsupported_media_type` | Extension not in section 0.2 |
| 422 | `decode_failed` | Allowed extension but cannot be decoded, 0 frames, or fps <= 0 |
| 422 | `video_required` | Image sent to Stage 2, or to Stage 1 with `mode=dense` |
| 422 | `video_too_long` | Stage 2 video, or Stage 1 `mode=dense` video, would need > 30 windows of 2 s |
| 503 | `weights_missing` | Weights file for the requested model is absent |
| 503 | `model_load_failed` | Weights present but loading or the runtime contract (class names, threshold keys, strict state_dict) failed |
| 503 | `privacy_model_unavailable` | Local YuNet model is absent or cannot be loaded; no unblurred preview is returned |
| 422 | `anonymization_incomplete` | Full-frame scan did not cover every advertised video frame; the video is not shown |
| 404 | `not_found` | Any path under `/api/` that is not an endpoint above |
| 405 | `method_not_allowed` | Known `/api/` path with the wrong HTTP method (`Allow` header lists the allowed ones) |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Unexpected server error. The body never contains a stack trace; the traceback is logged server-side |

Validation order: `missing_file` → `invalid_parameter` → `unsupported_media_type` → `file_too_large` → `video_required` → `weights_missing`/`model_load_failed` → `decode_failed` → `video_too_long`.

Fixtures: `error_stage2_image.json` (422), `error_weights_missing.json` (503).

Paths outside `/api/` are the static UI (`mockup/`); their 404s use the server's default body, not this format.

## 5. Run the web prototype

```bash
# from the repo root; weights in ./weights (or set CCTV_WEIGHTS_DIR)
.venv-cuda/Scripts/python -m uvicorn webapp.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` — the UI (`mockup/`) and API share one origin. The prototype has no authentication; keep it bound to loopback and do not expose it to a LAN or the internet.
Numerical note: the server runs X3D-S (and YOLO) in **fp32**, while the Stage 2 notebook evaluated under fp16 autocast, so Stage 2 probabilities can differ slightly from the recorded test metrics in `artifacts/model_handoff/stage2/`. Preprocessing is identical to the notebook.

Playback note: the browser overlay assumes the video's `currentTime` equals `index / fps` as read by OpenCV. Variable-frame-rate files, or MP4s whose start time is not zero, can drift by about one frame. Dense mode on CPU (up to 1,800 YOLO runs for a 60 s clip at 30 samples/s) can be slow, and no progress is shown.

Models load lazily on the first analyze request (`GET /api/health` shows `available` → `loaded`); the GPU (`cuda:0`) is used when available, otherwise the CPU.
